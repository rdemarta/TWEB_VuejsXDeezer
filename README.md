This is an exercice made during the TWEB course at HEIG-VD in 2020. The goal was to learn Vue.js and and to work with an external API, in this case Deezer's API.

> In this exercise, you'll practice with Vue.js, Vue Router, and Vuex by building a music player web application. The application will fetch Data from [Deezer Simple API](https://developers.deezer.com/api) and use the [HTML audio element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) to play tracks in the browser. Here is an illustration of how your app could look like:
